== Development
To test and develop this gem, additional requirements are:
* rspec
* fakeweb
* tokyocabinet
* mongo
* redis

You will need to have {Tokyo Cabinet}[http://fallabs.com/tokyocabinet/], {MongoDB}[http://www.mongodb.org/], and {Redis}[http://code.google.com/p/redis/] installed on your system and running if you intend to test these storage engines.
You may add spec/testing_these_engines.rb and redefine $TESTING_STORAGE_ENGINES to specify which engines to test
